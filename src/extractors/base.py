        Splits source code into statement-level chunks by locating the
        enclosing function/method node and returning its body's direct
        (named) children as individual statements.

        This is stable across formatting differences (blank lines, brace
        style) because it relies on the actual AST structure rather than
        whitespace — unlike a blank-line split, a vulnerable snippet and its
        rewritten fixed counterpart are segmented by real statement
        boundaries, not by how many empty lines the author happened to leave.

        Args:
            source_code: Source of a single method/function (or a bare
                fragment of statements without an enclosing function).
            parser: A configured tree-sitter Parser for this language.
            function_node_types: Node types identifying a function/method
                declaration in this grammar.
            container_node_types: If given, the function body node must be
                one of these types to be treated as a statement container
                (guards against e.g. a JS/TS arrow function whose body is a
                bare expression, not a block).
            unwrap_container_types: If given and the body's only named child
                matches one of these types, descend into it (e.g. Go wraps
